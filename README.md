# module19-challenge

## User Story

AS A developer

I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection

SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use

## Acceptance Criteria

    - I should be able to see a client server folder structure when I open my 
    applications in my editor
    - I find that my application should start up the backend and serve the client when I run "npm run start" from the root directoyr
    - I find that my JS filed have been bundled using webpack when I run the text editor application from the terminal
    - I find that I have generated a HTMl file, service workr, and a manifest file when I run my webpack plugins
    - I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without error when I use next-gen JavaScript  in my application
    - I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage when I open the text editor
    - I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB
    when I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window
    - I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB
    when I reopen the text editor after closing it
    -I download my web application as an icon on my desktop when I click on the install button
    - I should have a registered service worker using workbox when I load my web application
    -  I should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets when I register a service worker
    - I should have proper build scripts for a webpack application when I deploy to Heroku
